>The @import directive is used to import the files in the code. It spreads the LESS code over different files and allows to maintain the structure of code easily. You can put the @import statements anywhere in the code.
 
 For instance, you can import the file by using @import keyword as @import "file_name.less".
 
 **Examples:**
 
 `@import "style";      // imports the style.less
  @import "style.less"; // imports the style.less
  @import "style.php";  // imports the style.php as a less file
  @import "style.css";  // it will kept the statement as it is`
